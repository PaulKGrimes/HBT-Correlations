# HBT-Correlations
Calculate the impact of HBT correlations on the mapping speed of a mm-wave telescope.

This code generates plots for the publication by Hill and Kusaka, "Photon Noise Correlations for Millimeter-wave Telescopes" and can be modified to quickly estimate the impact of Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations when designing mm-wave focal plane layouts.
